Benefits:
- Can use any name for tags, the actual name will be displayed.
- Uses plotly plots, full flexibility.

Aims:
- Separates data storage and display code - can define and re-style display post computations/storage.

Transparent computations:
- What is Tensorboard's wall time? How is smoothign computed? How are histograms computed?

Things to do:
- Better separation between data and display.
- Common interface to add new plots by user used to create histograms.
-
