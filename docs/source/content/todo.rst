To-Do's
========

 .. todo::

    * Add average visualization to scalar displays.

    * "Data store" dropdoown persistence broken after data store file discovery functionality was added.

    * Make tabs sticky on top, make them narrower and collapsible

    * Move hard-coded styling to single css file.

    # 

    * Make launch load files automatically on every interval (when a --discover option is specified).
 
    * Decouple data store and visualization      
    
      * Create a parent DataStore class with no data_records.index column, and a derived class that has the index column.      
      * Change data_records.index to data_records.time_step.	
      * Consider adding data record insertion support by means of a "parent" data_records column.
   
    * Support copying to clipboard from "Data Store" and "Global Step"  dropdowns. Might require a dcc.Clipboard component for each.

    * Rename figure_defs table to display_defs - it should contain all displays, including those generated by FigureHandler and TableHandler objects. Accordingly rename figure_handler module to "display_handlers" (plural).

    * Rename 'data' to 'series'.

    * Use css styling to transpose DataTable produced by TableHandler to make the header row disappear and make the first column have the same style as the header row for the non-transposed table.

    * Replace DataTable by HTML table to support copy-paste operations.

    * Add better code display -- potentially make the diff a link to a different page, might want to use https://diff2html.xyz/.

    * Better support for copying text in dropdown menus and tables (tables might be solved by using an html table instead of a Dash DataTable).

    * Fix the following Dash warnings::

        The dash_core_components package is deprecated. Please replace
        `import dash_core_components as dcc` with `from dash import dcc`
          import dash_core_components as dcc
        /home/zjoaquin/git/jazs-git/ploteries/ploteries/cli_interface/figure_handler_hook.py:14: UserWarning:
        The dash_html_components package is deprecated. Please replace
        `import dash_html_components as html` with `from dash import html`
          import dash_html_components as html
        /home/zjoaquin/git/jazs-git/ploteries/ploteries/cli_interface/table_handler_hook.py:2: UserWarning:
        The dash_table package is deprecated. Please replace
        `import dash_table` with `from dash import dash_table`

        Also, if you're using any of the table format helpers (e.g. Group), replace
        `from dash_table.Format import Group` with
        `from dash.dash_table.Format import Group`
          from dash_table import DataTable

    * Add a marker that indicates the last point in the trace. This is important particularly when there is a single point in the trace. Using a marker for every point is too dense, as sometimes there are a lot of points. Can also add a point that indicates the global step.

    * Ploteries should continue to display transparently if a file was deleted and re-created. Right now, it display `Error loading layout`.
