To-Do's
========

 .. todo::

    * Make tabs sticky on top, make them narrower and collapsible

    * Move hard-coded styling to single css file.

    # 

    * Make launch load files automatically on every interval (when a --discover option is specified).
 
    * Decouple data store and visualization      
    
      * Create a parent DataStore class with no data_records.index column, and a derived class that has the index column.      
      * Change data_records.index to data_records.time_step.	
      * Consider adding data record insertion support by means of a "parent" data_records column.
   
    * Support copying to clipboard from "Data Store" and "Global Step"  dropdowns. Might require a dcc.Clipboard component for each.

    * Rename figure_defs table to display_defs - it should contain all displays, including those generated by FigureHandler and TableHandler objects. Accordingly rename figure_handler module to "display_handlers" (plural).

    * Rename 'data' to 'series'.
